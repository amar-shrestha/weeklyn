                    <button class="faq-question">What is dry cleaning?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dry cleaning is a process that cleans clothes and textiles using a chemical solvent rather than water. This method is ideal for delicate fabrics that can't withstand the rough and tumble of a washing machine and dryer.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>While many types of fabric benefit from dry cleaning, not all can be treated this way. Fabrics like silk, wool, and certain synthetic fibers are ideal for dry cleaning, whereas others may require specific care instructions.</p>
